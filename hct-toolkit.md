# **<span style="color:darkcyan">Topic Introduction</span>**

Title V Maternal and Child Health Bureau Services program recommends addressing Health Care Transition for children, from pediatric to adult health care, between ages 12 years and 22 years. Rigorous efforts have been made since 2015, to develop, assess and implement Health Care Transition (HCT) Initiative in Oklahoma. Provider and family studies are being conducted, on on-going basis to help achieve national performance measures by year 2020. Sooner SUCCESS (State Unified Children's Comprehensive Exemplary Services for Special Needs) in collaboration with Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OKDTrANHS) and partnering agencies, is preparing a toolkit to facilitate community-based outreach and promotion. These measures are intended to advocate awareness among providers and families, especially for children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCNs) in-order to maximize their life-long functioning and potential via un-interrupted health care services.

This toolkit contains information for children and youth with special health care needs and families to guide them about the resources available in the state of Oklahoma and information about topics including health insurance coverage, legal guardianship, foster care, decision making and self-care. It will help them to take charge of planning and managing their own health and goals.

###  **<span style="color:darkcyan">Transition Policy</span>**
+	Develops a transition policy/statement with input from youth/young adults and families that describes the practice's approach to transitioning to an adult approach to care at 18, including privacy and consent information.

+	Educates all staff about the practice's approach to transition, the policy/statement, the Six Core Elements, and distinct roles of the youth, family, and health care team in the transition process, taking into account cultural preferences.

+	Posts policy and share/discuss with youth and families, beginning at age 12 to 14, and regularly review as part of ongoing care.





### **<span style="color:darkcyan">Description</span>**
Creating a written practice policy on transition is the first element in these health care transition quality recommendations. Developed by your practice or health system, with input from youth, families and young adults, the policy provides consensus among the practice staff, mutual understanding of the process involved, and a structure for evaluation. The policy should include the practice's approach to partnering with youth to develop independence and self-care skills. It should also explain the legal changes that take place in privacy and consent at age 18. The policy should be shared with youth and families beginning at ages 12 to 14 and publicly posted.





# **<span style="color:darkcyan">Transition Readiness</span>**

It is very important to assess youth's transition readiness and self-care skills. Using a standardized tool for transition assessment is a key for engaging youth and their families to set their health priorities and prepare them for an adult approach to care at age 18 and navigating the adult health care system including health insurance. Transition readiness should being at age 14 and continue through their adolescence and young adulthood. 
The organization Got Transition has several transition readiness assessment tools for youth as well as their parents/ caregivers and also for you with intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities and for their parents/ caregivers. 

#### **<span style="color:darkcyan">Oklahoma Healthy Transitions Initiative (OHTI)</span>**

The Transition Readiness Assessment forms are very important for everyone especially for youth, parents, and providers. It is an integrated approach towards a successful healthcare transition. It includes a range of questions such as, does the child understand his/her basic healthcare needs and disabilities, and can the child express her needs to his/her family and doctors. Majority of the Transition Readiness Assessment is designed to cover and elaborate on questions such as these. But there are some questions such as, if the youth can co-sign his/her consent form, or of the youth can discuss his/her healthcare decisions with their parents, or if the youth can take care of his/her medical equipment, and if the youth knows about his/her health insurance coverage after he/she turns 18. Information to help answers these more difficult questions can be found in different Transition Readiness Assessment Forms provided by organizations such as Got Transition or Universities/Federal Entities.
